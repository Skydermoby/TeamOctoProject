# Team Octo Project
This is Team Octo's Project Repository, which contains every project milestone. 

For our project, we designed and developed a digital equivalent of Kanban boards, following the software development lifecycle closely while using Agile as our main methodology. The result is a lightweight application that promotes productivity by establishing greater inter-developer communication and understanding.
